# TLB-Simulator-with-Replacement-Algorithms

● Developed TLB simulator with FIFO, Random, and Corbato’s Clock replacement algorithms.

● Implemented parsing of binary input files and command line arguments for simulation parameters.

● Displayed output of virtual & physical addresses for each translation, along with tracking page faults, TLB hits, & misses.
